It has started with my personal issues, having too crowded mind, I have alwayas felt that there are too many noises in my head.

My personal goal to live more mindfully were more challenging due to issue with my screentime myself. Mindless scrolling made it more noises.

In the same time, my love for travelling have led me to different places, that some encounters with people, places nad moments deserve a proper record, especialy for myself. 

It's not my goal for these words got dis

I’m Bakhrul Ulum — a nomadic freelancer who travels with a backpack or a bicycle, from coastal paths to mountain trails, from city streets to quiet ferry decks.

I live with a mind that often feels crowded. This blog is my way of slowing it down — to notice, to connect, and to share.

I’m not here to follow trends or feed algorithms. I’m here to write for the slow readers — the ones who bookmark an article to read later, who’d rather spend five minutes on a story than 15 seconds on a reel.

If you read this, I hope you do it mindfully — with a cup of tea, on a quiet morning, or while waiting for the next ferry.

Why I Write
To make sense of the noise in my head.

To appreciate the people, places, and moments I encounter.

To connect with those who value slowness in a fast world.

To resist the constant pull toward shorter, faster, noisier content.

To encourage mindful attention in travel, work, and daily life.

Core Themes
Mindfulness in Motion — traveling, cycling, hiking with presence.

Lightweight Nomadism — living and working with minimal gear, often on the move.

People & Places — encounters worth remembering, landscapes worth pausing for.

Mental Clarity — thoughts on distraction, attention, and living with intention.
